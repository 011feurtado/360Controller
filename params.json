It includes a plugin for the Apple Force Feedback Framework so some games \r\nwill be able to activate them, along with a Preference Pane with which allows you to test everything \r\nis installed correctly. Both wired 360 controllers connected via USB, and wireless 360 controllers \r\nconnected via the Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows, are supported.\r\n\r\nThe driver was originally created by Colin Munro. In 2014, I contacted Colin offering my help in updating the \r\ndriver to run properly under Mac OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\". My email went unanswered. Given that Colin has\r\nnot updated the driver in over a year, and that he has not answered my attempts at contacting him, I have\r\ndecided to fork the driver and update it. If Colin and I do sync up we will likely re-merge efforts;\r\nfor now consider this version to be the definitive version for newer versions of Mac OS.\r\n\r\nAs for why it needed updating - starting with 10.10, Apple requires that kexts (device drivers) for Mac\r\nfollow some new rules. One of them is that they be digitally signed by a paid Mac developer. In order\r\nto sign the driver I needed to be able to build it; as my development machine is 10.10 based I was forced\r\nto update the driver to compile on 10.10. This required many changes which are outlined in the developer section below.\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nThis driver is licensed under the GNU Public License. A copy of this license is included in the \r\ndistribution file, please inspect it before using the binary or source.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSimply complete the installer package to install the driver. The driver will recommend you restart - \r\nif you do not, the driver will only be usable if the controller is already connected or connected \r\nwithin a minute after the installer completes. If you are interested in installing as a developer please see below.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe driver exposes a standard game pad with a number of standard controls, so any game that supports \r\ngaming devices should work. In some cases this may need an update from the manufacturer of the game or \r\na patched version. The Preference Pane uses the standard Mac OS X Frameworks for accessing HID devices \r\nand accessing Force Feedback capabilities, so should be a good test that the installation is functional.\r\n\r\n## Known Problems/Todo\r\nColin's last version of the driver had some functionality I have temporarily had to remove:\r\n* Force feedback is currently disabled until I can rewrite it into the main driver (not a plugin). \r\n* I also had to remove the feature that allowed the preference pane to rewrite the Info.plist for the driver as that cannot be allowed any longer in a signed driver.\r\n\t  \r\nThis is the old Todo list. These things are still in play once I get the above issues fixed.\r\n* \tThe rumble motor test on the triggers of the Preference Pane bypasses the Force Feedback Framework functionality, so isn't actually testing it. It really should, for completeness (and it'd help adding support for more complex effects) - this test is now disabled in the normal release anyway\r\n* \tForce Feedback plugin may make effects run slower (e.g. longer time) than they should\r\n* \tDriver probably needs to be more resilient to errors and odd cases\r\n* \tBetter Force Feedback \"emulation\"\r\n* \tExtra settings? E.g. trigger deadzones, control remapping.\r\n* \tSomeone has requested old Xbox Controller support too. It is unlikely that I will do this.\r\n\r\n## Developer info\r\nAnything below this probably doesn't affect end users, so you can stop reading now if you just want to use the driver.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nThe distribution currently consists of multiple projects contained in an XCode workspace - one for the driver \r\n(implemented in C++, as an I/O Kit C++ class), one for the force feedback support plugin (implemented in \r\nC, as an I/O Kit COM plugin) and one for the Preference Pane (implemented in Objective C as a preference pane plugin). \r\nThere are additional projects for the wireless receiver. These should probably all be in a single project\r\nbut Colin didn't start it out that way and I've not yet made that happen.\r\n\r\nTo build, use the standard Xcode build for Deployment on each of the projects. Right now the Feedback plugin builds\r\nbut it cannot be installed into the main controller bundle as it breaks the signature. Also, the build script \r\ndoes not currently work and is only included for reference.\r\n\r\n## Debugging\r\nMost of the debugging I did was via printing out text. In 360Controller, you can use IOLog(), and the \r\noutput will appear in system.log. In Feedback360 normal fprintf(stderr,...), and the output will appear \r\non the console of whatever application is attempting to use Force Feedback. In Pref360Control NSLog() works \r\nas it's an Objective C program, and will output to the console of the Preferences application.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nI wrote the driver from scratch, using Apple documentation and drivers simply as a reference and not \r\nbasing it upon any existing source. As such, some things may be done strangely or incorrectly, so excuse any \r\nweirdness. I've also tried to include comments to explain generally what's going on :)\r\n\r\nYou will be unable to install kexts you build yourself unless you have a kext signing enabled Developer ID,\r\nor you put your Mac into kext debugging mode - i.e. \"kext-dev-mode=1\". If you don't know what any of that means,\r\njust run the binary installer package that I provide.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
